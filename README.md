# Day Planner
This repository ("Day-Planner") is where I built a calendar app using html, css,Bootstrap, JavaScript & Jquery. The goal for the project was to create an app which allows the user to save their scheduled events for each hour of the day. 

This web browser application is intended for use as daily schedule organiser to keep track of important events, meetings & deadlines during the work day on an hourly basis. It enables to professionals to see their day at a glance, scheduled time effectively, and improve productivity by changing its colours according to the current time.

The application is fully responsive through Bootstrap.
